This package contains the (modified) code generated by running
$ROTSYS/tutorials/tmva/TMVA_SOFIE_Keras.C
The modifications were to separate the Session class
declarations from their implementation.
This allows the code to be ompiled and saved in an obect library.

The package also includes a copy of
SOFIE_common.cxx
as that is not included in libTMVA.so for some reason.

note the .cxx and .C files are renamed .cc to allow the mu2e build system to find them.

The package includes a mu2e test module that constructs the
model and invokes the inference function, just to test that it works.
